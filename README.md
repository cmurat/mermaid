Well, you can't use it right now :)

## Contribution
If you like the idea and you think you can build upon it, you could pull this project and make your changes. After that you can make a pull request. I will look at your code and intergrate it with the project. 

Or, you could write me a message. I am very open to suggestions, this is why I put it on github :)
